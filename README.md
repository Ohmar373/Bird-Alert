# 🐦 BirdAlert

BirdAlert is a community-driven birdwatching web application built with **Python** and **Django**. It allows birdwatchers to log sightings, upload photos or descriptions, and record when and where birds are observed. By sharing verified sightings, Bird-Alert helps users discover proven birdwatching locations and identify observation patterns over time.

This project is developed as a **Computer Science senior project** with an emphasis on full-stack web development, database design, and real-world data sharing.

## 🧠 Project Motivation

Birdwatching often relies on word-of-mouth or scattered online forums to locate birds in specific regions. BirdAlert centralizes this information into a single platform where users can contribute verified sightings, making birdwatching more accessible, collaborative, and data-driven.

---

## 📌 Learning Objectives

This project focuses on applying core computer science and software engineering concepts, including:

* Full-stack web application development
* MVC/MVT architecture using Django
* Relational database design
* User authentication and authorization
* File uploads and media handling
* Clean code practices and documentation

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Interactive map visualization of sightings
* Bird species filtering and search
* Commenting and discussion on sightings
* Admin moderation tools
* Mobile-friendly UI
* AI-based bird image classification

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.10+** ([Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- **Git** ([Download here](https://git-scm.com/))
- A terminal/command prompt

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ohmar373/Bird-Alert.git
cd Bird-Alert/Bird-Alert
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

Create an isolated Python environment for the project:

```bash
# On macOS/Linux:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

You should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root (same directory as `manage.py`):

```bash
touch .env  # On Windows: type nul > .env
```

Add the following to your `.env` file:
```
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
```

### Step 5: Run Database Migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Step 6: Load Bird Species Data

The application includes a comprehensive database of **10,000+ bird species** from the eBird/Clements checklist. Load this data:

```bash
python manage.py import_birds bird_alert/data/BirdSpeciesList.csv
```

**Note:** This may take 2-3 minutes to complete. You'll see progress updates as the import runs.

### Step 7: Create a Superuser (Admin Account)

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to create your admin account. You'll use this to access the admin panel.

### Step 8: Run the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Step 9: Access the Application

Open your browser and visit:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

To access the admin panel:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
```

## 🔒 Security Notes

- **Never commit `.env` file** - It's already in `.gitignore`
- **Keep `SECRET_KEY` private** - Generate a new one for production
- **Debug mode:** Only enable `DEBUG=True` during development
- For production, update `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in `settings.py`
